/**
 * The files in the config dictionary's ``desktop_dir`` (``$HOME/Desktop``
 * unless a plugin changes it), listed in a panel over the wallpaper on
 * every monitor. This side only places the panels and owns their buffers;
 * what's in them -- the file list, its scanner thread (all file system access
 * is there, so a hung mount can't block the compositor), the layout, the look
 * and what clicks do -- is desktop_panel.c in ``libawlplugins.so``, so it
 * reloads with the plugins. Without the library, no panel. Main thread only.
 *
 * The panels live in their own scene tree right above ``LyrBg``, so they
 * cover the wallpaper (background.h) and background layer surfaces but
 * nothing else, and they're not part of ``layers[]``, so ``xytonode()`` and
 * clicks go right through them.
