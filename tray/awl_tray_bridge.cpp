//
// This is deliberately close to the tray's original standalone design

// dwl owns (awl_tray_init()/awl_tray_shutdown() from dwl.c's run()/
// cleanup()) instead of being spawned as a separate process, and it's
// auto-positioned from dwl's real bar geometry/layout (awl_tray_set_bar_geometry
// from updatebar(), awl_tray_set_widget_x() from the systray widget's own
// draw call) instead of hardcoded gtk-layer-shell margins.
//
// dwl's render thread never touches GTK/D-Bus directly: it calls
// awl_tray_width()/_set_widget_x()/_set_bar_geometry(), which only touch a
// few atomics/a small mutex, or marshal work onto the GTK thread via
