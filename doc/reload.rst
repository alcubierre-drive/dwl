Live reload
===========

``make`` builds ``awl`` and ``libawlplugins.so``. With awl running,
``plugin_restart`` (MOD+Ctrl+r in config_plugins.def.h) swaps in the freshly
built library: new widgets, new plugin code and config_plugins.h,
without restarting awl or any client.

What a reload picks up
----------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Reloads with the library
     - Needs a restart of awl
   * - widgets.c, desktop_panel.c, plugins.c, plugins/ (except redraw.c)
     - awl.c, awl_draw.c, desktop.c, background.c, plugin_host.c, the tray
   * - config_plugins.h: keys, buttons, rules, layouts,
       colors, font, borders, blur, input devices, keymap, tray and
       wallpaper settings
     - config_awl.h: tags, the bar's position, autostarts, logging
   * -
     - any change to `awl_host_t`, `awl_plugin_api_t` or to a struct both
       sides read (`Monitor`, `Client`, `awl_draw_t`, `widget_t`, `Arg`), i.e.
       anything that bumps `AWL_PLUGIN_ABI`

Monitor rules apply to outputs that appear after the reload. A library that
was built against a different awl refuses to load (see
`awl_plugin_entry_t`); the old one then stays and its plugins are just
restarted.

The sequence
------------

``plugin_restart`` usually runs from a key binding, i.e. from code in the
library that is about to be unloaded, so it only schedules the reload on the
event loop's next idle round. Then `awl_plugins_reload()`:

#. Copies the library file into a memfd and loads that with ``dlopen()``,
   so every load gets the current file, and a ``make`` rewriting the file
   can't change the copy in use. The Makefile links under a temporary name and
   renames, so a reload during a build sees the old or the new library,
   never half of one.
#. Looks up `AWL_PLUGIN_ENTRY` and calls it with awl's `awl_host_t`; the
   library compares `AWL_PLUGIN_ABI` and the struct sizes and returns its
   `awl_plugin_api_t`, or NULL.
#. Calls awl's ``pluginsdetach()``: the hover popup gets its leave callback,
   every bar's widgets are freed (`awl_draw_widgets_clear()`), and awl falls back
   to its built-in config, since the current one points into the old
   library.
#. Stops the old library's threads (`awl_plugin_api_t.fini`) and unloads it,
   unless a thread is stuck in the kernel (see :doc:`threads`): then the old
   library stays mapped for good.
#. Starts the new library's threads (`awl_plugin_api_t.init`).
#. Calls awl's ``pluginsattach()``: switches to the new library's config and
   applies what changed (``configapply()``), gives every bar its widgets
   again and redraws.

Afterwards awl also rebuilds the tray's D-Bus state, which can go stale after
suspend, and hands it the new tray settings (`awl_tray_reload()`).

As a sequence, with the library's threads in it:

       else a thread is stuck
         Note over O: stays loaded for good
       end
       H->>H: api = the new one
     else it didn't
       H->>O: api->fini(), the same library goes on
     end
     H->>N: api->init(paused): starts its threads
     H->>D: pluginsattach()
     D->>N: configuse(): api->config(), configapply()
     D->>N: bar_widgets() for every bar

     D->>D: awl_tray_reload(cfg->tray)

The library's lifetime
----------------------

awl starts the library's threads at startup and on a reload, and stops them
on a reload and at exit:

.. mermaid::

   flowchart LR
     setup["awl starts:<br/>setup()"] --> load["awl_plugins_load(0)"] --> init1["api->init()"]
     restart["plugin_restart"] --> reload["awl_plugins_reload()"] --> fini2["api->fini()<br/>of the old library"] --> init2["api->init()<br/>of the new one"]
     cleanup["awl exits:<br/>cleanup()"] --> unload["awl_plugins_unload()"] --> fini3["api->fini()"]

What ``api->init()`` and ``api->fini()`` do (plugins.c). The scanner and the
wallpaper thread may get stuck on a dead mount, so they are given 500 ms;
the poller is joined without a limit.

.. mermaid::

       i1["awl_plugin_start():<br/>ip, stats, temp, bat, date"] --> i2["poller_new()"]

     end
     subgraph fini["api->fini()"]
       direction TB
       f1["awl_desktop_stop():<br/>up to 500 ms"] --> f2["awl_wallpaper_stop():<br/>up to 500 ms"]
       f2 --> f3["poller_stop(): joined"] --> f4["pulse_free(), backlight_free(),<br/>poller_free(), the rest freed"]
       f4 --> stuck{"a thread<br/>left running?"}
       stuck -- no --> r0["returns 0:<br/>the library may be closed"]
       stuck -- yes --> r1["returns nonzero:<br/>the library stays mapped"]
     end
     init ~~~ fini

The config split
----------------

awl.c includes config_awl.h, and config_plugins.def.h as the fallback for
while no library is loaded. awl_config.c includes config_plugins.h and turns
it into an `awl_config_t` with `AWL_CONFIG_TABLE`; awl.c does the same with
config_plugins.def.h. Only the library ever sees config_plugins.h.

The functions config_plugins.h binds keys to are awl's; in the library, they
are same-named wrappers that call awl through `awl_host_t.actions`, so the
file reads like a dwl config.h. A function it binds has to be listed in
`AWL_ACTIONS` (or `AWL_ARRANGES` for layouts), or be one of the library's own
actions, which awl_config.c defines next to the wrappers (``notifyconfig``,
``backlighttoggle``). The wrappers and those actions aren't static, so any
of them may stay unbound without a warning, and the library exports none of
them. config_plugins.def.h, which awl itself is built with, can bind only
`AWL_ACTIONS`.

Adding to the ABI
-----------------

Adding a function to `awl_host_t` or `awl_plugin_api_t`, or changing a
struct both sides read:

#. Change the table in awl_plugin_abi.h and bump `AWL_PLUGIN_ABI`.
#. Fill in the new entry: in plugin_host.c for the host table (awl.c for
   `AWL_ACTIONS`), in plugins.c for the library's.
#. Rebuild and restart awl: the running one would refuse the new library.
