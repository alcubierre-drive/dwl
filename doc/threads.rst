Threads
=======

awl's main thread runs the Wayland event loop and must never block: a
stalled main thread freezes every window, the cursor included. Everything
that may wait, on the disk, the network, D-Bus or a decoder, happens on
another thread.

The threads
-----------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 25 55

   * - Thread
     - Where
     - What it does
   * - main
     - awl.c
     - wlroots, input, drawing the bars and panels, taking the wallpaper
   * - ``poller``
     - plugins/poller.c
     - one PulseAudio main loop for all status plugins: CPU, memory,
       temperature and clock once per second; battery and IP address on
       kernel events; volume and the backlight timer on their own events
   * - ``desktop``
     - desktop_panel.c
     - watches ``desktop_dir`` with inotify and lists it
   * - ``wallpaper``
     - plugins/wallpaper.c
     - lists the wallpaper directory, picks one, decodes it
   * - tray
     - tray/
     - the GTK main loop: StatusNotifier host and watcher, the tray windows,
       the calendar

The rules
---------

The main thread never touches the file system.
   On a hung mount, e.g. a remote one, any file system call can block
   indefinitely, ``stat()`` and ``open()`` included. So the desktop panel's
   scanner and the wallpaper's decoder do all of it, and the main thread
   only gets their results.

Results are handed over, not shared.
   A thread publishes its result whole, through an atomic pointer or
   atomic values, so neither side ever waits for the other's lock. The
   status plugins keep their readings in atomics (e.g. `awl_stats_t`), the
   scanner hands over a copy of its list, the decoder a finished
   `awl_image_t`.

Changes are announced with a redraw request.
   `awl_redraw_request()` may be called from any thread. The main loop
   handles all requests since its last wakeup at once.

Threads are woken, never cancelled.
   Every library thread is an `awl_thread_t`: it sleeps in ``poll()`` on its
   own eventfd among others, and `awl_thread_stop()` sets a flag and makes
   the eventfd readable. The thread returns when it next looks.

A stuck thread is left behind.
   A thread blocked in the kernel, e.g. on a dead mount, can't look. The
   scanner and the decoder are given 500 ms to stop; after that, their
   state is abandoned with them, never freed, and since their code must stay
   mapped, the old library is never unloaded (`awl_plugin_api_t.fini`
   reports it). A reload still starts fresh threads in the new library.

Signals belong to the main thread.
   `awl_thread_start()` blocks all signals in the threads it starts.
   Children are spawned with ``vfork()``, not ``fork()``, since a fork can
   inherit a lock another thread held at that moment.

Who talks to whom
-----------------

Solid arrows are data handed over, dashed ones wakeups. The main thread
wakes the library's threads through their eventfds; they wake it through the
redraw eventfd, and it then picks up whatever they published.

The life of a thread
--------------------

Every thread of the library is an `awl_thread_t`, started and stopped the
same way. Only the poller is waited for without a limit: the only files it
reads are in ``/proc`` and ``/sys``, which can't hang like a remote mount.

The poller
----------

One PulseAudio main loop drives all status plugins. The 1 s tick is aligned
to the wall-clock second, so the clock never lags; battery and IP address
only wake the loop when the kernel reports a change, with a slow re-read on
the tick as a safety net.

.. mermaid::

     wait -- "1 s tick" --> fresh{"fresh?<br/>(just resumed)"}

     chg1 -- no --> wait

     wait -- "PulseAudio, D-Bus" --> other["pulsetest.c, backlight.c<br/>event sources"] --> wait

     wait -- "wake_fd" --> woken{"awl_thread_woken():<br/>quit?"}
     woken -- yes --> quit["quit the loop,<br/>the thread returns"]
     woken -- no --> sync["sync_paused()"]
     sync -- "paused" --> stoptick["free the tick"] --> wait
     sync -- "resumed" --> starttick["new tick, due now,<br/>fresh = 1"] --> wait

Pausing comes from the main thread, whenever no bar is visible (locked, or
every output off):

.. mermaid::

   sequenceDiagram
     participant M as main thread
     participant P as poller thread
     M->>M: updatepluginpause()
     M->>P: awl_plugins_set_paused(1)<br/>poller_set_paused(): paused = 1, wake
     P->>P: wake_callback(): sync_paused()<br/>frees the tick
     Note over P: only battery and IP events<br/>still wake it, without redraws
     M->>P: awl_plugins_set_paused(0)<br/>paused = 0, wake
     P->>P: sync_paused(): new tick, due now
     P->>P: tick: update_all()
     P-->>M: awl_redraw_request()

A wallpaper change
------------------

Requests are counters, so several in a row cost one change, and
`awl_wallpaper_settled()` can tell whether the wallpaper shown is the one
all of them end on.

.. mermaid::

   sequenceDiagram
     participant M as main thread
     participant W as wallpaper thread
     M->>W: awl_wallpaper_step(+1)<br/>steps += 1, asked += 1, wake
     W->>W: takes asked, then steps, random, back
     W->>W: change(): lists the directory,<br/>picks, sets wallpaper_index,<br/>where = (cur, n, rand_next), done = asked
     W->>W: decode() the PNG (Wuffs)
     W->>W: pending = image<br/>(frees one not taken yet)
     W-->>M: awl_redraw_request()
     M->>M: redraw_fire(): wallpapertake()
     M->>M: awl_wallpaper_take(): pending = NULL
     M->>M: background_set(): fade in
     Note over M: settled while done == asked:<br/>then plugins.c tells "x/N"

The desktop scanner
-------------------

.. mermaid::

   sequenceDiagram
     participant M as main thread
     participant S as desktop thread
     S->>S: inotify on desktop_dir<br/>(retried every 5 s while missing)
     Note over S: an event: wait 50 ms for more,<br/>500 ms at most
     S->>S: findfiles(): the list
     S->>S: pending = copy, if it changed
     S-->>M: awl_redraw_request()
     M->>M: desktop_update_all()
     M->>M: awl_desktop_version(): takes pending,<br/>version + 1 if it differs
     M->>M: redraws the panels whose version changed
