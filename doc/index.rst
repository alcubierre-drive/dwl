awl
===

awl is a Wayland compositor that grew out of `dwl
<https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl>`_, the dwm-like compositor based on wlroots,
and has moved far enough from it to go by its own name. It extends dwl into a
small desktop: a bar with status widgets, a system tray with a calendar, a
wallpaper with timed changes and fades, a panel with the files on the
desktop, and notifications. Most of that is in a separate library that a
running awl can rebuild and reload without a restart. The bar's drawing code
started out as `drwl <https://codeberg.org/sewn/drwl>`_.
