Writing and building these docs
===============================

Building
--------

The documentation is built with Sphinx, the Read the Docs theme and
`Hawkmoth <https://jnikula.github.io/hawkmoth/>`_, which reads the C sources
with libclang. Once, set up the Python environment (a venv outside the
source tree, ``~/.local/share/venvs/awl-doc`` unless ``VENV`` says
otherwise)::

   make -C doc venv

Then, after every change::

   make -C doc

and open ``doc/_build/html/index.html``. The sources are parsed with the
Makefile's flags (pkg-config, scenefx, ``-DXWAYLAND``), so the generated
protocol headers and config.h have to exist: run ``make`` first.

Doc comments
------------

Hawkmoth documents what has a doc comment, ``/** ... */``, right before it.
Plain ``/* ... */`` comments stay out of the docs, so implementation notes
can stay plain.

* A doc comment at the top of a file, before the ``#include`` lines, is that
  file's overview.
* Struct members need their comment on the line(s) before them; a comment
  after a member on the same line isn't picked up.
* The text is reStructuredText. Backquotes, as in `` `awl_tray_join()` `` or
  `` `awl_host_t.actions` ``, make a C expression whose names link to their
  documentation. Use double backquotes for code that isn't C or isn't
  documented here (````$HOME````, ````notify-send````), and for anything with
  a ``*`` in it, which reStructuredText would take for emphasis.
* Prose that doesn't belong to a single file goes into the ``.rst`` pages
  under ``doc/``.
