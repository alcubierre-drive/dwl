/* Threads: any thread may call any function but awl_dict_destroy(). Each call
 * holds the dict's lock while it runs, so on its own it is atomic. Whatever
 * has to see the dict unchanged across several calls holds the lock itself,
 * with awl_dict_lock()/awl_dict_unlock():
 *  - using a string or owned pointer from awl_dict_get() or awl_dict_next(),
 *    which another thread could otherwise free by overwriting or removing
 *    the entry (plain pointers and numbers are copies, they need nothing),
 *  - a read-modify-write, like incrementing a number,
 *  - iterating with awl_dict_next() (awl_dict_iter() holds it for you).
 * The lock is recursive, so the functions can still be called under it. It
 * is a plain mutex otherwise: hold it briefly, and don't wait for anything
 * under it, least of all another thread that may want it. An owned value's
 * free function runs under it, too. */
